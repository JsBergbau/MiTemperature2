# Read data from Xiaomi Mijia LYWSD03MMC Bluetooth 4.2 Temperature Humidity sensor

With this script you can read out the value of your LYWSD03MMC sensor, e.g. with Raspberry PI. Note Raspbery Pi 4 has a very limited bluetooth range. PI Zero W gives much longer range.

This sensor doesn't transmit its values in the advertisment data, like the LYWSDCGQ Bluetooth thermometer. This is more privacy friendly since no one can sniff your temperature readings. On the other side this means you have to establish a bluetooth connection with the device to get the data. When you're connected no other connection is accepted, meaning if you hold the connection no other can readout your temperature and humidity.

Once you're connected the LYWSD03MMC it advertises its values about every 6 seconds, so about 10 temperature/humidity readings per minute.

## Prequisites / Requirements

You need Python3 3.7 or above because of the dataclasses used in the Callback Function. If you don't have Python 3.7 please take the previous version from here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/5d7b215d7b22d4c21d9244f8a4102513b928f2c7/LYWSD03MMC.py This version is a bit behind and connection error handling has a bug. If you really need this script, please open and issue and I'll post a new bugfree version.

For example Raspbian Stretch has only Python 3.5.3. If you like to upgrade your Distribution to current Buster release follow this Tutorial https://pimylifeup.com/upgrade-raspbian-stretch-to-raspbian-buster/ If doing so: Omit the rpi-update step.

If you like installing/compiling Python3.7 please take a look at this tutorial https://gist.github.com/SeppPenner/6a5a30ebc8f79936fa136c524417761d However it took about 5 hours to compile/run the regressiontests on a Raspberry PI3B. I use this compiled version directly without install. If you do, too, you have to change the first line in the script, pointing to your compiled Python version. For bluepy you can copy the bluepy-folder from home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/bluepy to <yourPath>Python-3.7.4/Lib and do a chmod +x bluepy-helper in <yourPath>Python-3.7.4/Lib/bluepy

Prequisites: python3 bluez python3-pip bluepy
install via

`sudo apt install python3 bluez python3-pip`

`pip3 install bluepy`

                        Enter an offset to the reported humidity value

2 Point Calibration:
  --TwoPointCalibration, -2p
                        Use complex calibration mode. All arguments below are
                        required
  --calpoint1 CALPOINT1, -p1 CALPOINT1
                        Enter the first calibration point

                        Pass the path to a program/script that will be called
                        on each new measurement
  --name NAME, -n NAME  Give this sensor a name reported to the callback
                        script
  --skipidentical N, -skip N
                        N consecutive identical measurements won't be reported
                        to callbackfunction
```

Note: When using rounding option you could see 0.1 degress more in the script output than shown on the display. Obviously the LYWSD03MMC just trancates the second decimal place.

Reading the battery level with the standard Bluetooth Low Energy characteristics doesn't work. It always returns 99 % battery level. Or to be correct, sometimes 10 % when the battery is really empty, see https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/1#issuecomment-588156894 . But often before that device just shuts down before it can report another battery level. With every measurement the Aqara sensor also transmits the battery voltage. This voltage is transformed into a battery level 3.1V are 100%, 2.1V 0%.

The `--count` option is intended to save even more power. So far it is not proven, that only connecting at some interval will actually save power. See this discussion https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/3#issuecomment-572982314

With the `--interface` option you specify the number of the bluetooth adapter to use. So `--interface 1` for using hci1

## Tips

Use `sudo hcitool lescan --duplicate` to get the MAC of your Sensor.
This sensor only sends its measurements only via notifications. There are quite often notifications because the temperature is measured with a precision of 2 decimal places, but only one shown on the display (and this value is truncated, see above). Trying to directly read/poll the characteristics returns always zeroes.

### Debouncing

The temperature values often change between the same values. To get cleaner temperature curves a debouncing function has been implemented. See here https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/2 for more info.

### Minus degrees

When looking at the specifications this LYWSD03MMC Sensor is specified from 0 °C to 60 °C. The LYWSDCGQ (the Bluetooth Temperatur sensor with the round display and an AAA battery) is specified from -9.9. I can confirm this sensor also goes down to -9.9 °C. At colder temperatures it only shows an "L". But the correct data is still sent! So you even could use ist to watch the temperature in your freezer. However batterylife may be significantly reduced at those low temperatures.

### High battery usage

There is currently no way to detect a too high battery drain except having empty batteries in less than 2 month. If you encouter lots of empty batteries, please reduce distance between LYWSD03MMC sensor and your Bluetooth receiver. With a voltage drop of 0.1 V in 1.5 month everything is perfectly fine. If it is a bit more, don't worry. Can be a button cell of lower quality. For more infos please visit https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/32

### More info

If you like gatttool you can use it, too. However it didn't notice when BT connection was lost, while this Python-Script automatically reestablishes the connection.

```
gatttool -I
connect AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
#enable notifications
char-write-req 0x0038 0100
#enable lower power mode, please don't do when you want to interact with the device, because often then connection gets lost
char-write-req 0x0046 f40100
#Read battery-Level, just for reference, since it is always 99 consider: note value is in Hex format
char-read-hnd 0x001b
```

Strictly speaking enabling notifications every time is not necessary since the device remembers it between connects. However to make it always work, the Python-Script enables them upon every connection establishment.

Notification format
`Notification handle = 0x0036 value: f8 07 4a d6 0b`
f8 07 is the temperature as signed INT16 in little endian format. Divide it by 100 to get the temperature in degree Celsius
4a is the humidity. Only integer output :(
d6 and 0b are the battery voltage in Millivolts in little endian format.

Lower power mode: To safe power the connection interval is reduced. For more details, please see this Issue https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/18#issuecomment-590986874

There can be done a lot more with that sensor. It stores highest and lowest values at hour level, has an integrated realtime clock and a few things more like changing the values for the comfort icon on the display. Credits go to jaggil who investigated on this and documented it well. You find the results here https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/1 Just search for jaggil.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes script fails to connect and tries to connect forever.
Just exec `killall bluepy-helper` You can even do this while script is running. It will disconnect, but recovery automatically.

Since version 1.1 there is a watchdog-Thread checking when connection is lost for at least 60 seconds and then killing the corresponding bluepy-helper, so that other connections aren't affected. This is a workaround for an obvious bug in bluepy. This bug only occured so far when trying to (re)connect. Then this call to bluepy blocks sometimes forever.

If that doesn't help, a problem with the bluetooth stack could be the cause. To resolve:

```
sudo hciconfig hci0 down
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```

## Calibration

Especially humidity value is often not very accurate. You get better results if you calibrate against a known humidity. This can be done very easy with common salt (NaCl). Make a saturated solution and put it together with the Xiaomi Bluetooth thermometer in an airtight box. Ensure that no (salt) water gets in contact with the device. Saltwater is very corrosive.
Wait about 24 hours with a constant temperature. You should now have about 75 % relative humidity. I don't know how long it takes for the sensors to drift. So I will redo this procedure about every year.

### Offset calibration

E.g. mine shows 79 % RH when actually there is 75 %. Excecute the script with `-o -4` to substract 4 from the readout value.

### Two point calibration

The offset is not linear over the whole humidity values. So you should calibrate at another point. MagnesiumChloride is recommended giving about 33% RH at 20 °C. Also Calciumchloride is suitable, but the humidity depends more on temperature. Be sure to have 20 °C. https://www.salzwiki.de/index.php/Deliqueszenzfeuchte

My Xiaomi Bluetooth thermometer shows 39% RH at 33% RH. So wie here have an offset of 6.
Another hygrometer show 69 % at 75% RH and 33% RH at 33% RH. So offset +6 at 75% TH and offset 0 at 33% RH.
Example for the Xiaomi to use 2 point calibration:
At 75% RH you have to substract 4 from the readout value, at 33% RH you have to substract 6.

`-2p -p2 75 -o2 -4 -p1 33 -o1 -6`

```
-2p: Enables 2 point calibration
-p2 75: Point 2 at 75% RH
-o2 -4: Offset -4 at Point 2
-p1 33: Point 2 at 33% RH
-o1 -6: Offset -6 at Point 2
```

Note the values in between are interpolated linear and the result is rounded to the nearest whole number. It makes no sense to give floatingpoint number when the input is none.

Output example:

```
./LYWSD03MMC.py -d AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -2p -p2 75 -o2 -4 -p1 33 -o1 -6
Trying to connect to AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
Temperature: 20.62
Humidity: 54
Battery voltage: 2.944
Calibrated humidity: 49

Temperature: 20.6
Humidity: 54
Battery voltage: 2.944
Calibrated humidity: 49

Temperature: 20.61
Humidity: 54
Battery voltage: 2.944
Calibrated humidity: 49

```

## Callback for processing the data

Via the --call option a script can be passed to sent the data to.
Example
`./LYWSD03MMC.py -d AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -2p -p2 75 -o2 -4 -p1 33 -o1 -6 --name MySensor --callback sendData.sh`
If you don't give the sensor a name, the MAC-Address is used. The callback script must be within the same folder as this script.
The values outputted depends on the options like calibration or battery. So the format is printed in the first argument.
Example callback

```
#!/bin/bash
echo $@ >> data.txt
```

Gives in data.txt `sensorname,temperature,humidity,voltage,humidityCalibrated,timestamp MySensor 20.61 54 2.944 49 1582120122`

Whereas the timestamp is in the Unix timestamp format in UTC (seconds since 1.1.1970 00:00).

There is an option not to report identical data to the callback. To distinguish between a failure and constantly the same values are read, the option takes the number after which identical measurements the data is reportet to the callback. Use the `--skipidentical N` for this. E.g. `--skipidentical 1` means 1 identical measurement is skipped, so only every second identical measurement is reportet to callback. I recommend numbers between 10 and 50, giving at least every minute respectively 5 minutes a call to the callback script (With 10 and 50 the actual time is slightly higher than 1 respectively 5 minutes). It is recommended to use the `--round` and `--debounce` option, otherwise there is a lot of noise with changing the temperature. See https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/2

All data received from the sensor is stored in a list and transmitted sequentially. This means if your backend like influxdb is not reachable when a new measurement is received, it will be tried again later (currently waiting 5 seconds before the next try). Thus no data is lost when your storage engine has some trouble. There is no upper limit (the only limit should be the RAM). Keep this in mind when specifing a wrong backend.

"sendToInflux.sh" is an example script for sending the data to influxdb via http-API. Precision was set to the level of seconds. This gives better compression ratios in influxdb.
